# ProMoAI & PMAx

**ProMoAI** is an AI-powered suite for Process Mining that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the gap between natural language and technical process analysis. The framework now includes **PMAx**, an autonomous agentic system for data-driven insights.

The suite consists of two primary modules:

1. **ProMoAI (Model Generation):** Transforms text or event logs into formal process models (BPMN/Petri nets).
2. **PMAx (Agentic Analytics):** An autonomous multi-agent framework that functions as a virtual process analyst to query event logs and generate data-grounded reports.

## Features

### 1. ProMoAI: Model Generation & Refinement

- **Text-to-Model:** Generate BPMN or PNML models from natural language descriptions.
- **Model Refinement:** Upload an existing BPMN or Petri net and use AI to modify or extend it via chat.
- **Discovery Baseline:** Start with an XES event log to discover an initial model, then refine it using the LLM.

### 2. PMAx: Agentic Process Mining (New!)

- **Autonomous Reasoning:** Uses a "divide-and-conquer" architecture with specialized **Engineer** and **Analyst** agents.
- **Privacy-Preserving:** Only lightweight metadata (column names/types) is sent to the LLM. Raw event data never leaves your local environment.
- **Deterministic Accuracy:** The system generates and executes local Python code (using whitelisted data preprocessing libraries) to compute exact metrics, avoiding LLM hallucinations.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Automatically generates tables, statistical charts, and narrative insights from high-level business questions.
